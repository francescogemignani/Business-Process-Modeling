### Description
The project is about the process by which a client books a dog training session. More details are written in the project [track](https://github.com/francescogemignani/Business-Process-Modeling/blob/main/p49-DogTraining-it-GemignaniTelera.pdf). The collaboration diagram is created with BPMN notation. From this latter, we used WoPed to design the network and perform a semantical analysis of the net, describing the characteristics of the reachability graph. 

### Course Objectives
The course presents techniques for Business Analytics according to the processdriven view of Business Process Modeling. It presents the main concepts and problematic issues related to the process management, where processes are understood as
workflow over some basic activities, and to show some of the languages, conceptual
models and tools that can help to handle the main problems in a proper way. During the course, the students will become acquainted with the technical terminology
of the area, with several rigorous models that can be used to structure and compose
processes, with the logical properties that such processes can be required to satisfy
and with specific analysis and verification techniques. Moreover they will be given
the possibility to experiment with some advanced tools for the design and analysis of
business processes.

### Syllabus
1. Introduction to Key Issues in Business Process Management.
2. Terminology and Classification.
3. Process Modeling. Conceptual Models and Levels of Abstraction.
4. Rigorous Workflow Models: Petri Nets and Workflow Nets.
5. Tool-supported Workflow Design and Analysis: Experimentation with Integrated Tools for Business Process Design, Analysis and Verification.
